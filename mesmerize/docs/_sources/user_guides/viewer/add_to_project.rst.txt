Add a Sample to the Project
***************************
When you are happy with the ROIs in the viewer for the current CNMF(E) derived or manually created ROIs, you can add this as a *Sample* to your project.

Each sample in your project contains the following:
	- The imaging data from which ROIs were extracted (the video)
	- All the ROIs with their spatial location, temporal dynamics, and any tags that you have entered in the ROI Manager.
	- Stimulus mappings, if your project is configured for this.
	- Meta data (that were associated with the imaging video), the date, video framerate.
	- Any further information that you have chosen to add based on your Project Configuration

.. note:: If your ROIs were obtained through CNMF/CNMFE the following attributes from the final cnm object are stored: cnm.A, cnm.b, cnm.C, cnm.f, cnm.YrA

How to
======
To add the current *viewer work environment* (see above) as a sample to your project, go to File -> Add To Project. You will be presented with a window similar to this:

.. image:: ./add_to_project/1.png

The entries that you are prompted with directly correspond to the custom columns in your Project Configuration.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Project Configuration <project-configuration>`

Every Sample in a project has a unique **SampleID** which is the combination of **AnimalID** + **TrialID**.

.. warning:: **You can never change the AnimalID or TrialID (i.e. SampleID) since these are partially used as unique identifiers.** A workaround is described in the :ref:`FAQ for Project Organization <faq-project-organization>`.

.. warning:: AnimalID and TrialID are separated by the ``-_-`` character combination when stored as a SampleID. Therefore do not use that character combination within your AnimalID or TrialID.
