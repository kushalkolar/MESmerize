.. _module_CaimanMotionCorrection:

Caiman Motion Correction
************************

Perform motion correction using the NoRMCorre implementation in the CaImAn library.

**I highly recommend going through the following before using this module**

    - NoRMCorre paper
        `Pnevmatikakis, E. A., & Giovannucci, A. (2017). NoRMCorre: An online algorithm for piecewise rigid motion correction of calcium imaging data. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 291, 83â€“94. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.07.031>`_

    - The CaImAn demo notebook, the implementation in Mesmerize is basically from the demo
        https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn/blob/master/demos/notebooks/demo_motion_correction.ipynb

.. image:: ./caiman_motion_correction.png

**Parameters**

Output bit depth: The motion corrected image sequences are of float32 type. You can optionally convert the output to 8 or 16 bit uint types to save disk space. **This doesn't always work from my experience, values might get clipped**.

For all other parameters please see the demo notebook mentioned above.

You can also enter parameters as keyword arguments (kwargs) in the text box if you select "Use motion correction kwargs". This is useful if you want to enter parameters that cannot be entered in the GUI for example. **Use single quotes if you want to enter string kwargs, do not use double quotes.**

Usage
=====

This module adds a "caiman motion correction" *item* to the batch. Set the desired parameters (see demo notebook) and then enter a name to add it as an *item* to the batch. After the batch item is processed, double-click the batch item to open the motion corrected image sequence in the viewer. You can then use this motion corrected image sequence for further analysis.

.. seealso:: This modules uses the :ref:`Batch Manager <module_BatchManager>`.

.. note:: The parameters used for motion correction are stored in the work environment of the viewer and this log is carried over and saved in the *Project Sample* as well. To see the parameters that were used for motion correction in the viewer, execute ``get_workEnv().history_trace`` in the viewer console and look for the ``caiman_motion_correction`` entry.

.. warning:: If you're using Windows, large `memmap` files will linger in your batch dir or work dir, you can clean them out periodically.

Script Usage
============

A script can be used to add caiman motion correction batch items. This is much faster than using the GUI.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Script Editor <module_ScriptEditor>`

Add items
---------

This example shows how to add all tiff files (of image sequences) from a directory as batch items with 3 different variants of parameters.

.. seealso:: This example uses the :ref:`Caiman Motion Correction Module API <API_CaimanMotionCorrection>`, :ref:`ViewerWorkEnv API <API_ViewerWorkEnv>`, and :ref:`Batch Manager API <API_BatchManager>`

Crop and add items
------------------

This example shows how to crop videos prior to adding them as batch items. This is useful if you want to crop-out large unchanging regions of your movides. It uses either simple thresholding or spectral salieny on a standard deviation projection to determine the bounding box for cropping.

    auto_crop = image_utils.auto_crop

    }
                
    # Spectral saliency is another method
    # You can try and play around with the parameters
    # If the cropping is insufficient, you can set "projection" to just "max" or "std"

    # or reduce padding. Default padding is 30 (when nothing is specified like above)
