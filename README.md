# Mesmerize

Mesmerize is a platform for the annotation and analysis of neuronal calcium imaging data. Mesmerize attempts to encompasses the entire process of calcium imaging analysis from raw data to semi-final publication figures that are interactive, and keep track of the analysis so that it can be recapitulated. It is applicable for a broad range of experiments and is intended to be used by users with and without a programming background.
