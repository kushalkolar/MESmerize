# New Mesmerize Packages
The Mesmerize desktop application within this repo is no longer supported. Please checkout the new mesmerize packages which have longterm support.

**These new packages are much easier to install! They are also much more efficient, versatile, and offer rich visualizations.**

The batch management system offered by the new package is conceptually similar to the original Mesmerize desktop application, but it is much more efficient.
